# Text Recognition Using OCR

This Python project demonstrates text recognition on images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for image processing. The script reads text from images, draws bounding boxes around the detected text, and visualizes the annotated images.

## Features

- Utilizes the EasyOCR library for text recognition, supporting multiple languages.
- Integrates with OpenCV for image loading, preprocessing, and annotation.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected text with corresponding labels.
- Supports visualization of annotated images using matplotlib.
